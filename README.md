### layer toggle visibility

This script looks for common layer / group names and allows you to toggle the visibility of all at once. Useful if you have common frame animations for things like `body -> idle -> up`, `arm -> idle -> up`, etc.

### layer replace

[layer-replace-with-lookup-map.lua](layer-replace-with-lookup-map.lua) is designed for use with [aarthificial's pixel art animation strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYch_TIkq6w&t=435s). It automates replacing each pixel with a unique color value.

To use, copy the script(s) you want to use into your Asesprite scripts folder. For more information, view [here](https://community.aseprite.org/t/aseprite-scripts-collection/3599).
